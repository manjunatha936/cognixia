              <p>Unless otherwise stated, the contents of this site including, but not limited to, the text and images contained herein and their arrangement are the property of Cognixia. All trademarks used or referred to in this website are the property of their respective owners.</p>
              <p>All Fee components would attract applicable taxes.</p>
              <p>The learner must ensure that his/her name is correct in the records of Cognixia. All communications including the certificate will reflect the same name, wherever applicable. The learner’s contact information specified during registration will be used for any/all communications. In case there is a change in the contact information, the learner must inform the support team.</p>
              <p>All content, videos and material is the property of Cognixia and is not meant for re-distribution. All training materials are for the learner’s personal use and not meant for commercial use. They may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior permission of Cognixia.</p>
              <p>A learner will be entitled to a Cognixia Certificate only on completion of the course assessment. (Wherever applicable). A learner is entitled to an ‘Excellence Certificate’ on securing 40% and above in the course assessment. In case the learner secures <40%, then he/she may opt for either a re-assessment subject to re-assessment charges, or may agree to receive a ‘Participation Certificate’. (Wherever applicable). Cognixia will try their best to ensure that the learner receives his/her certification within 15 working days of successfully clearing the assessment. (Wherever applicable).</p>
              <p>Requests for re-scheduling the examinations/assessments are highly discouraged. However, if due to unavoidable circumstances, the participants are unable to appear for the examination/assessment, re-examination is allowed, subject to payment of re-scheduling fee.</p>
              <p>Cognixia may, in case of unavoidable circumstances, change the schedule of the batches by informing the learners in advance. A learner is expected to complete the training in the same batch as assigned during registration.</p>
              <p>A trainer is not equipped to handle grievances/queries which are not related to the curriculum. For all such queries, the learner may reach out to Cognixia Support. Cognixia Support will be available from 0700 hours to 2100 hours EST. Lifetime LMS access implies initial access for a period of 2 calendar years from the date of registration. If the learner wants to continue access, then he/she must pay an administration charge of $ 50 to extend the access for 2 more years.</p>
              <p>Learners are not entitled to any refunds for any amounts they may have paid in part or full.</p>
              <p>Cognixia will be providing assistance in the placements for eligible candidates as per request. Here, Cognixia will be sharing eligible resumes with partner organisations. Cognixia does not guarantee placements.</p>
              <p>Cognixia reserves the right to suspend or terminate a learner’s account and refuse or restrict any and all current or future use of Cognixia Services, without any liability to the learner, at its sole discretion. Cognixia reserves the rights, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove any portion of these Terms and Conditions in whole or in part, at any time. Changes in these Terms and Conditions will be effective when notice of such change is posted. Your continued use of the Cognixia site after any changes to these Terms of Use are posted will be considered acceptance of those changes.</p>

              <p>Force Majeure: Cognixia shall not be liable for delay or failure in performance of any of its obligations when such delay or failure arises from events or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of Cognixia (including, without limitation, acts of God, fire, flood, war, explosion, sabotage, terrorism, embargo, civil commotion, acts or omissions of any government entity, supplier delays, communications or power failure, equipment or software malfunction, or labour disputes).</p>
