      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <div class="sn-openmodal__cnt">
          <p>A leading Oil & Gas processing plant consumes large amounts of electricity to produce the gas needed to sustain its demand worldwide. Electricity cost is a key driver in their operational expenditure, and most of the consumption is caused by gas compressors. The status quo entails running these compressors at maximum throughput, which comes at a very high energy cost. However, maximum production may not necessarily be the best approach from an environmental and economical perspective. The client turned to Mobiquity to explore how it could optimize electricity consumption and reduce CO2 emissions while maintaining a high and stable production.</p>

          <p>To address this challenge Mobiquity applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). We did this by leveraging our Digital Traction methodology, a framework for organizing digital innovation programs for optimal success. We provided this client with the following solution:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A Machine Learning model that accurately models the workings of the plant.</li>
            <li>The model predicts how the plant will evolve over time and is able to accurately predict energy consumption.</li>
            <li>By using this model, optimal settings can be discovered to optimize energy consumption and thereby reduce costs.</li>
